        <li>“Finding someone who listens is really hard<br>
          when growing brows back so I really appreciated<br> 
          that she did what i asked. That was about a month<br>
          ago. I will be going back this week to get them cleaned<br>
          again. She told me to come back one a month until<br>
          they grow in to my desired thickness then I can come<br> 
          more frequently if needed. “</li>

          was perfect and that I was completely satisfied.<br>
          I got an eyebrow/upper lip threading for cheaper <br>
